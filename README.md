# hello_world
Hello World! This is my first repository and I am creating it to learn to use git. You can know more about me from this repository
\\%%%\\
I actually worked on github before in a previous project. But I almost forgot everything I have learned since I haven't used it since then. I am now trying to relearn it again and this time take even a step further. This repository is my starting point.
